         This was originally the default behavior for all platforms, but
         it's a bad idea on devices where the BACK key is a capacitive
         button (since it's too easy to press the key accidentally as you
         pull the phone out of your pocket.)  So devices that *don't* want
         this behavior should set this flag to false via the resource
         overlay.  -->
